// Kickoff - the magic happens here

// Include bootstrap base.  This will also include a base variables.less
@import "bootstrap/bootstrap.less";

// Include the bootswatch theme's variables.less and bootswatch.less
// bootswatch.less is equiv. to it's own custom.css which includes
// customizations not possible with variables alone.
@import "bootswatch/cerulean/variables.less";
@import "bootswatch/cerulean/bootswatch.less";

// These are your own files to modify and update as you see fit.  Note if
// you generate a FULL variables.less from Twitter's online generator, it
// WILL overwrite Bootswatch's.  Instead, pick and choose individual
// customizations if this is an issue.
@import "variables.less";
@import "custom.less";

// Do not remove it unless you are sure.
// See this URL for further reading on why this is re-included.

@import "bootstrap/utilities.less";

// Remember this file is meant for development and demos only!  You should
// use a real less compiler against this file and generate a compiled and
// minimized version of your CSS before deployment.
